# Sponsorship packages

ScaleConf is organised by volunteers, but there are still huge expenses when
it comes to putting together a successful conference. Sponsorship helps us to
keep ticket prices affordable.

We've structured our sponsorship this year to make sure that you can build
up the benefits in a way that makes sense for your company.

#### Baseline

Our starting point for sponsorship, the baseline package provides its value
by giving you exposure and presence at the conference.

    Company name or logo in attendee emails
    Company name in press releases
    Company logo on website footer
    Company bio on website sponsors page
    Two conference tickets
    10% off additional tickets

#### Level up

Sponsors with the baseline package may want to build their package out a bit
towards a specific purpose such as recruiting or presence. Below are some
options which can be added to the baseline package.

##### Spotlight

Put your company in the spotlight, and be seen at the conference.

    Prominent placement and larger logo wherever used
    Banner in main hall (to be provided)
    Logo on Lanyard

##### T-Shirt
    
    Company Logo on the back of the t-shirt

##### Coffee

Our attendees love coffee, and they love our coffee sponsors.

    Coffee sponsor designation
    Mention and Logo on the back of lanyard inserts
    Mention during announcements

##### Events

We like to keep everyone socializing and networking, so on the evenings of the
9th-11th of April, we will be giving sponsors the opportunity to host events.

    Official event sponsor
    Host attendees for dinner, and/or drinks.

##### Presence
    
If you're looking to have some of your engineers on the ground, we would love
to have some of your engineers bring a stand and talk shop with our attendees.

    Area at the back of the hall (3m x 3m)
    Three extra conference tickets

##### Adopt a Student

Cape Town is full of smart but penniless computer science students wanting to
experience and learn from events like this. It is also such a great
opportunity for them to meet engineers from your company, ask questions, and
get involved.

    Cost: R1,000

##### Not found

If you'd like to sponsor, but none of these options suit you, get in touch
with us at info@scaleconf.org, and we can discuss how else you could be
involved.
