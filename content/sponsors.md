# Sponsorship packages

ScaleConf is organised by volunteers, but there are still big expenses when it comes to putting together a successful conference. Sponsorship helps us to keep ticket prices affordable. If you'd like to sponsor, but none of these options suit you, get in touch with us at info@scaleconf.org, and we can discuss how else you could be involved.
